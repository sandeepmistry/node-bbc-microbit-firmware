# Getting Started
The mbed BLE API is meant to be used in projects on developer.mbed.org. Please see examples and sample project files there.
A good starting point are these pages:
* [mbed BLE Homepage](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/) for all things BLE
* [mbed BLE Getting Started Guide](https://developer.mbed.org/forum/team-63-Bluetooth-Low-Energy-community/topic/5262/) a wonderful primer on using BLE with mbed
* [mbed BLE doc](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/ble-intros/en/latest/) for an introduction to mbed BLE
* [mbed BLE API page](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/ble-api/en/latest/api/index.html) for the Doxygen API documentation
